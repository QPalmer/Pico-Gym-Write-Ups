## Solution

I inspected the page and found some client-side javascript right away. Oopsies.

There's probably a sexier way to patch the flag together, but I just manually copied the pieces of the flag in the correct order. 

This problem looks like a simple cautionary tale in not letting your scripts just sit client side so anyone can see what they do.
