## Solution

Login as Joe? Joe who? 

If you login as anyone other than 'Joe' you can use any password you want. This doesn't return the flag however. <br>
Hrmm...Joe must has special privileges. <br>

I did a lot of rooting around differnet parts of the web inspector with no luck. Then I remembered that cookies exist! 

Could it be as simple as just changing admin to 'True' in my cookie?

Well there it is! Changed the admin value to `True`, refreshed the page, and the flag appeared:
