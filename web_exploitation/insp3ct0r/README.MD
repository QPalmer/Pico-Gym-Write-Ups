## Description
> Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection:http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

## Solution


1st part of the flag is in the `<body>`
> <!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->

2nd part of the flag is in the css file - "mycss.css"
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/mycss.css
> You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */

Which means the 3rd part of the flag must be in the JS file
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/myjs.js
>/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399} */

Yes Kishor, Javascript is neat. Aptly put.

This is a nice introduction to the constituent elements of a basic website and how to use the web inspector search through the "html ball pit". Pretty easy to do with such a simple site. Hardest part was properly copy / pasting the pieces together to form the flag. 

Who is Kishor Balan? Someone who can't get an SSL certificate for his site apparently:
