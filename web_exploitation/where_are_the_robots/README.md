### Solution

Started by inspecting the entire page. Checked and double checked the style sheet, font list with a lot of ctrl+F for "picoCTF" but did not find anything. 

I cheated here because I had no idea where to start. 

robots.txt is an SEO related thing from what I can tell. It also doesn't get used much anymore
