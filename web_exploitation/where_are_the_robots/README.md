## Solution

Started by inspecting the entire page. Checked and double checked the style sheet, font list with a lot of ctrl+F for "picoCTF" but did not find anything. 

I had to do some web searching to find out where to start here and ran into an SEO related thing (at least from what I can tell) called a robots.txt file. These are used to allow / disallow webcrawlers from indexing different parts of your site. Added `/robots.txt` to the end of the url and found the 'hidden' part of the site.

`User-agent: * `
`Disallow: /8028f.html`

Added `/8028f.html` to the end of the url and got a page with the flag on.
