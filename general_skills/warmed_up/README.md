### Description
> What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

### Solution
There are a lot of conversion calculators online and I was able to use one of these to convert '3D' in base 16 to '61'

But what does this mean? 

A Base 10 model would look like this:

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`

A Base 16 model looks like this: 

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F `

So "Base 16" and "Hexidecimal" mean the same thing. 

Hexidecimal is easier to convert into Binary than decimal. There is a good line from this wikipedia article that explains this: 

>For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, which can be conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.

Referenced this chart to confirm "Base 16" 0x3D is "61" in decimal.
